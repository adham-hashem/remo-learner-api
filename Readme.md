## üß© Architecture Details

- **Controllers**  
  Handle HTTP requests and delegate operations to the service layer.  
  _Examples_: `AuthController`, `StudentController`

- **Services**  
  Contain business logic and orchestrate operations between controllers and repositories.  
  _Examples_: `AuthService`, `StudentService`

- **Repositories**  
  Handle data access logic, interacting directly with the `ElearningPlatformDbContext`.  
  _Examples_: `StudentRepository`

- **Entities**  
  Represent the structure of database tables using domain models.  
  _Examples_: `ApplicationUser`, `Student`, `Course`

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**  
  Ensure clean and secure data transfer between layers and over the network.  
  _Examples_: `AuthResponseDto`, `CourseDto`
